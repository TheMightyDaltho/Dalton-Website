        <h1>World and Setting</h1>
        <figure class = "photoGallery">
            <img class="photo" src=gallery/theworld.PNG alt="The setting">
            <figcaption> The game take place in the aftermath of some cataclysim event that drove humans to live insided of giant 
            sentient robots caled Titans. We follow an unamed protagonist refered to as Healer as he tries to repair a broken Titan 
            named Toni. The game itself takes place almost entirely inside of Toni as Healer attempts to fix him. The creator uses broken down machinery, scattered trash and belongings,
            and strange technology to create the semi-abandoned interior of Toni.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h1>Characters</h1>
        <figure class = "photoGallery">
            <img class="photo" src=gallery/LifeBeforeToni.PNG alt="Life Before Toni">
            <img class="photo" src=gallery/peopleAcknowledged.PNG alt="People Acknowledged">
            <figcaption>Most of the character you interact with inside of Toni live there and are in charge of keeping Toni operational and are currently failing to do their duty. You play through the game by visiting different sections of Toni's body and solving their problems so they can get back to work or fix them yourself. The writing is charming and comedic and is a pleasure to get to know each character</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h1>Object Interaction</h1>
        <figure class = "photoGallery">
            <img class="photo" src=gallery/LetMeHelp.PNG alt="Dialog Trees">
            <img class="photo" src=gallery/happyinhabitance.PNG alt="AhYoungLove">
            <figcaption> You interact with objects on the ground by picking them up and using them in the appropriate place. You also interact with and talk to other characters to advance the story and get hints on what you need to do.
            There are also objects you can interact with that you don't need. Since you can only hold one item at a time, you need to pick what item you carry carefully.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h1>Challenges</h1>
        <figure class = "photoGallery">
            <img class="photo" src=gallery/wallhint.PNG alt="Puzzles">
            <figcaption>There are many, fairly simple puzzles throughout the game, most involve simple memorization or pattern recognition. Other puzzle involving knowing which item to use on what object such as knowing to use a screwdriver to open an vent and not a fish. There are also obstacle sections that make traversing back and forth dangerous and require some thinking.</figcaption>

        <h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
        <figure class = "photoGallery">
            <img class="photo" src=gallery/RIP.PNG alt="TheEnd">
            <figcaption>Overall this game was wonderfully put together. The story was touching and emotional at times while also having a sense of humor. I would absolutly recommend playing this game to other.
