      <figcaption>With the comparison of the most used words, I noticed that "man" and "time" 
        are very common words in both collection which is interesting to note. Day and Night are also both 
        present in the top 20 most used words. This shows me the importance of Time and People in both collections.
        Time is a major theme in a lot of Poes writings, since it's symbolism is closely tied to mortality. Multiple stories 
        within the fantasy collections are retellings of events that happened in the past, so time and the
        progression of are important to understanding the stories as a whole. </figcaption>

      <p> This once again shows the importance of times within both collections. The frequency and amount of use shows the need to frame events in relation to each other in retellings of events past.</p>

    <figure class = "photoGallery">
      <figcaption>"Out of the" Is also very common 3 NGram. This Highlights how most of the texts in both collections are themed around horror as phrases like "out of the darkness" or "out of the window" are common phrases in horror literature ot build tension</figcaption>
