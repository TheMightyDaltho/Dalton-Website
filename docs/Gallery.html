    <h1>Corpus Analysis Assignment</h1>
    <p> I compared the works of Edgar Allen Poe and other works of fictions including Frankenstein, 
      War of the Worlds, Dracula, and Moby Dick The reason I decided to compare these collections is because 
      they share common motifs of dread, gothic horror and monster stories and I thought it would be interesting
      to compare the similarities between the collections. The reason I chose to single out Edgar Allen Poe to compare
      against these other authors collections is because the collections of his poems and stories are quite extensive in 
      themes and motifs. I believed it would make comaparison with multiple other texts more cohesive and useful.</p>

      <figcaption>With the comparison of the most used words, I noticed that "man" and "time" 
        are very common words in both collection which is interesting to note. Day and Night are also both 
        present in the top 20 most used words. This shows me the importance of Time and People in both collections.
        Time is a major theme in a lot of Poes writings, since it's symbolism is closely tied to mortality. Multiple stories 
        within the fantasy collections are retellings of events that happened in the past, so time and the
        progression of are important to understanding the stories as a whole. </figcaption>

      <figcaption>The phrase "at the same time" appears frequently in both subsets of stories and quite consistantly</figcaption>

      <figcaption> "at the same time" is also the most frequent 4 NGram within the fantasy books compilation and the second most frequent within the Poe Collection.</figcaption>

      <img class="photo" src=gallery/NGramPoe.PNG alt="Ngram of Poe">
      <p> This once again shows the importance of times within both collections. The frequency and amount of use shows the
        need to frame events in relation to each other in retellings of events past.</p>
      <p></p>

    <figure class = "photoGallery">
      <figcaption>"Out of the" Is also very common 3 NGram. Which makes sense considering that most of texts within the collection have heavy themes of horror and dread.</figcaption>

      <img class="photo" src=gallery/ootFantasyComp.PNG alt="Occurance of 'out of the' within the fantasy comp">
      <p>The main context the NGram is used in is something looking out of something like darkness or mist or someone looking or hearing something out of a window or door.
        This theme of ceatures lurking hidden nearby or searching for something or someone is fairly common in horror as it builds dread for the eventual reveal.</p>
